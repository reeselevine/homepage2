I am a third year PhD candidate and an [NDSEG Fellow](https://ndseg.org/) at UC Santa Cruz, where I work with [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/) and am generally affiliated with the [LSD Lab](https://lsd.ucsc.edu/).

My research interests are in parallel and concurrent programming, specifically how multi-core and distributed systems are implemented. My current work focuses on GPU memory models, designing and evaluating techniques to test the conformance of compilers and hardware to specifications. I am also working on ways to exploit weak memory behaviors to increase applications' performance, and to test and improve the safety properties of GPU programming models in the face of data races or other undefined behavior.

For a demo of our work on testing GPU memory models, check out our memory model testing website [GPUHarbor](https://gpuharbor.ucsc.edu/webgpu-mem-testing), which is implemented using the WebGPU framework. If you want to contribute to our research, head to the [Tune/Conform](https://gpuharbor.ucsc.edu/webgpu-mem-testing/tuning/) page and follow the instructions there to run tests and submit experimental data about your GPU's memory model behavior.

## Personal

When I'm not thinking about computers (and sometimes when I am), I prefer to spend my time outside, including cycling, climbing, skiing, surfing Santa Cruz's many breaks, and playing on the beach with our dog Hunter.
