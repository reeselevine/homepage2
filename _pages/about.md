My research focuses on testing and improving programming models for multi-core and distributed systems, with my current work focusing on GPU memory models. At Santa Cruz, I work in the [LSD](https://lsd.ucsc.edu/) group under [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/).

## Research
* Testing memory models on GPUs. My work focuses on new testing strategies for exposing rare but allowed weak memory behaviors on GPUs and evaluating these strategies' ability to find potential bugs in compilers/hardware. See [GPUHarbor](https://gpuharbor.ucsc.edu) for the types of tests we're running, using WebGPU.
* Using bounded model checkers, like [Alloy](https://alloytools.org/), to help synthesize tests for distributed consistency models. The goal is to better characterize the behaviors of various data types under different consistency models, as well as provide programs that can be run directly on systems to test their correctness.

## Teaching
* TA, Parallel Programming, UC Santa Cruz, Spring 2021/Winter 2022/Winter 2023
* TA, Computer Architecture, UC Berkeley Summer/Fall 2016

## Personal

When I'm not thinking about computers (and sometimes when I am), I prefer to spend my time outside, including surfing Santa Cruz's many breaks and playing on the beach with our dog Hunter.
